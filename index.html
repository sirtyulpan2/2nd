                  <p>
                    Yes, we have 3 vets that specialize in different pets, from cats to parrots and exotic animals. Still,
                    we're not a vet clinic, so our vets provide only consultations and do not perform any procedures.

                  <p>
                    A pet sitter is a person that looks after your pets when you're out. It includes feeding, washing,
                    providing walks and exercises, etc.

                    Yes, you travel with peace of mind. We have a mini-hotel for all kinds of pets. It is spacious,
                    comfortable, and fully equipped.

                  <p>
                    Sure, if you need a pet sitter just once, you can order such a service. Also, you can request a pet
                    sitter for 1-2 hours and decide whether you want to use our services later.

                  <p>
                    It depends on the breed and the services included, so it's better to contact our managers. They will
                    gladly tell you the price for the grooming of your pet.
